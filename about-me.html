                Hello, my name is Laura (aka xcodecat). I'm a student and a novice programmer.
                Besides a few small side projects, there's currently no cool stuff I can show, but I'm working on it! 
                Since web development interests me the most, I'm sure there will be a few more projects soon. 
                I'm currently learning JavaScript and improving my HTML, CSS and Python  skills.
            </p>
